Tarea 8. Desarrollar un programa de clases para generar una factura
(Note: If you swipe from the left (:fa-arrow-left:) side of the screen, you can set up links to your favorite CommonMark files, change the picture, and set up a home page, but *++that's for later++*.)

## Create New Folder and a CommonMark file

Para ejecutar localmente, haga lo habitual:

#. Crear un entorno virtual de Python
#. Instalar dependencias:
    
    pip install -r requisitos/dev.txt





Now, if you name this new file `index.md`, as I asked, every time you enter that folder, this file will always be the first to greet you. Write there some welcoming message and place there links to other CommonMark documents, for example, by writing `[My Tasks](tasks.md)`.

:fa-exclamation-triangle: Avoid using spaces in filenames for the beginning. Do it later, when you master CommonMark using Epsilon Notes.

- [ ] Make a long tap on the file name.
- [ ] Choose `delete file`.
- [x] :fa-thumbs-up: Say "Wow! Cool!!!" :fa-smile-o:
